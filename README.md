# THIS IS A FORK OF [Desk-Penguin](https://github.com/TheShovel/Desk-Penguin/)

# Desk-Penguin
 [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com) native offline desktop app for Linux and Windows, now supporting NodeJs!
# Dependencies
- unzip
- zip
- bun
- git
- curl

This can only be built on Linux. If you want to do this on Windows, you will have to use something
like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).<br><br>
MacOS is not supported as I can't test the packages on that!! (certified Apple moment)

# How to use
Just open your terminal in the folder of the repository and run the script with
```
./build-app.sh
```

# Downloads
Don't want to build this yourself? You can find pre-built executables here in the github releases(stable builds) or the github action runs artifacts(source builds, may or may not be stable)
