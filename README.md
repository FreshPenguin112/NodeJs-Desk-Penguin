# Dependencies

This can only be built on Linux. If you want to do this on Windows, you will have to use something
like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).<br><br>
MacOS is not supported as I can't test the packages on that!! (certified Apple moment)

# How to use
Just open your terminal in the folder of the repositry and run the script with
```
./build-app.sh
```
Thats it! During the process it will ask you if you want to create zip files for the builds.
You can answer with Y or N (Y = Yes and N = No)

# Downloads
Don't want to build this yourself? You can find pre-built packages here:<br>
